# iDTech Rice 2019 Diaries

I have spend 6 weeks in total at Rice University's summer camp as Machine Learning and AI instructor.I worked in 
two different programs: Tech Camps and AI and Coding Academy.
The difference between them is, AI and Coding Academy takes two weeks and includes advanced topics such as Convolutional Neural Networks.

My audience were dominanlty junior/senior highschool students with a strong coding background. Some of them were already familiar with the basics of Machine Learning.

I taught two different courses summer-long: Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, and Machine Learning and Deep Learning. We started from Machine Learning fundamentals along with Python, some libraries like Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Pandas and finally Tensorflow and Keras to 24 students in total.

We developed more than ten different projects, which are all related to classification. Since they were high school students and expectedly, they do not know Calculus 1 and 2 subjects, I could not go further from classification. Their final projects were developing an image classifier program using Convolutional Neural Networks.

Pros of working as an instructor/mentor
I needed to study a lot to answer their questions about the topics we covered, hoever I knew the topics and studied since last year, an unexpected wuestion might came up, and at that moment I did not want my authority to get weaken. it is not professional to reply their questions with "idk"So this study gives you an understanding.

Cons
Teaching is hard, at least for me. Trying to explain the college level concepts to high school students makes teaching even more harder. 
Working hours in Academy was hard, three hours block sessions were an absolute torture for the students, and especially an ADHD person like me. I needed to find a way to keep them busy since it is impossible for me to keep lecturing for three hours. 
The curriculumn that they gave me was so weak. I ended up with creating my own curriculumn at the end of the first week.
It is not only teachin but mentoring an supervising. We were together with them for the whole day, if it would be only teaching but not supervising them, it would be much easier.
