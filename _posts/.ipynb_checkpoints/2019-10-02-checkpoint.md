# Grace Hopper Celebration
GHC is the largest event in the world which gathers women in tech all around the world to empower, share and learn supportI'm one of the luckiest person amongst 960 that had a privilidge to attend Grace Hopper Celebration 2019 in Orlando as a student scholar. 

Attending GHC made recognized me the need of a guidance since it wasI saw there is a need for a /post/blog post to guide me throughout the event. I deicided to write about my experience at the biggest conferene I ve ever attended and  GHC.

I believe my experience will light the way of the ones who plan to attend GHC 2020 next year.I will also give information about the convention center and the hotel provided for the scholars since GHC 2020 will be held the same location Orlando, FL next year.


## Bird's eye view
The atmosphere is exteremely excited, amazing GHC keynotes make you feel that you're belong. It makes you feel that you are exactly in the right place and makes you proud of where you're standing. Keynote opennings opens your eyes to a new world which is full of success of women in tech you would never heard of, and you recognize how speaking up/showing off/ being in the stage/achievemetns/ is/are the need in women in tech especially in computer science.


## Where to start 
Prioritize. 
Numerous sessions, events, talks happening at the same time, so you are going to miss a lot but will surely gain a lot. So do not worry about the things you would  miss, focus on the events that will be make you win.

If you are an undergraduate/ fresh grad/ masters/phD student who wants to get a job, get an interview spend the whole first and second day of the GHC at the career fair.
There are more than 100 companies including the legends like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Twitter, Facebook, Linkedin and more. And the good news THEY ARE HIRING! You are there to find a job, they are there to hire you. Most of the companies engineers are there, and you talk them in person, they look at your resume and give you advices, or even interview you in person and add your resume/CV to their database. And if you're a scholar the impact is way more different.

If you are a professional who attended there for the conferences, there are numerious happening at the same time besides the tech schowcase, and poster session at the career fair.
