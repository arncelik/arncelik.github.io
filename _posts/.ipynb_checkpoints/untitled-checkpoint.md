# Identifying Driver Mutations in Breast Cancer Cell 

## Project Description
SK-BR-3 is a breast cancer cell line that was isolated from a 43-year-old female patient from Memorial Sloan Kettering in 1970. While this cell line is used frequently in cancer research, no one has sequenced its genome to understand which mutations are driving cell line at 50X coverage depth. 

## Task:
My task was investigating and analysing  the data and detect somatic mutations using variant detection algorithms and annotation databases to determine if there are any driver mutations that occur in cancer genes.
