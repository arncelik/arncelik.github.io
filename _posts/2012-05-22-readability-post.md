# What is Keras?
Let's look at the definition of Keras before move on to explanation of my first task which is image classification 
###Definition: 

Keras is a high-level neural networks API, written in Python. 
It was developed with a focus on enabling fast experimentation. Being able to go from idea to result with the least possible delay is key to doing good research.

Use Keras if you need a deep learning library that:

* Allows for easy and fast prototyping.
* Supports both convolutional networks and recurrent networks, as well as combinations of the two.
* Runs seamlessly on CPU and GPU.

The core data structure of Keras is a model, a way to organize layers. The simplest type of model is the Sequential model, a linear stack of layers.

*After we
