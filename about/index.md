I am a senior software engineering student at North American University with a minor in Math Education and a prospective graduate student.
I have a strong desire to study Bioinformatics, Deep Learning applications in Genomics in particular. My goal is getting a PhD degree in Bioinformatics and running my own lab at UPenn. 
We will see, how things go.
