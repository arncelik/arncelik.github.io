I am a senior software engineering student at North American University with a minor in Math Education and a prospective graduate student.
I have a strong desire to study Bioinformatics, Deep Learning applications in Genomics in particular.I am also interested in cancer detection studies which ignited by a personal story.
My goal is getting a PhD degree in Bioinformatics and running my own lab at UPenn.
