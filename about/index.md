I am a Ph.D. student and a graduate research assistant at the University of Cincinnati College of Medicine and Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, studying cancer genomics. I am interested in deep genomics and lung cancer specifically.My goal is to continue in the  academia and run my own lab at my dream institution. We'll see how it goes.
